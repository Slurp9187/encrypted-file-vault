# EFV – Encrypted File Vault [PRE-RELEASE ALPHA]

**Current version:** `0.0.0` (active development)  
**First public release:** `v0.1.0` (clean repo, audited surface, real usability)

> This repository is a live workbench.  
> It will be deleted and replaced with a clean history at `v0.1.0`.

**Do not use EFV with real data yet.**

Everything here is being built in the open:
- Split-vault design (SQLCipher + separate index)
- Zero-plaintext legacy upgrades
- `zeroize` + `secure-gate` everywhere
- Future-proof crypto ergonomics

Security eyes, early feedback, and contributions are very welcome.

When `v0.1.0` drops, this repo gets archived and a fresh one starts with proper commit history, full docs, and a published threat model.

Until then: break things, file issues, help shape it.
